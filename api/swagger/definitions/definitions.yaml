                This is an enum based flag which lets you perform a specific type of search. Please chose one of the highlighted values from below.
                Allowed values:
                  
                  * `eq` - This mode will do an exact match for the provided field with the provided value. Only the first value in the values array will be considered.
                  * `neq` - This mode will do an exact not-equal match for the provided field with the provided value. Only the first value in the values array will be considered.
                  * `gt` - This mode will do a greater than comparison for the provided field with the provided value. Only the first value in the values array will be considered.
                  * `gte` - This mode will do a greater-than-or-equal-to match for the provided field with the provided value. Only the first value in the values array will be considered.
                  * `lt` - This mode will do a a less than comparison for the provided field with the provided value. Only the first value in the values array will be considered.
                  * `lte` - This mode will do a less-than-or-equal-to match for the provided field with the provided value. Only the first value in the values array will be considered.
                  * `range` - This mode will check whether the record for the provided field-name lies within the range specified. Only the first and last element of the provided values array will be considered.
                  * `set_include` - This mode will match the record for the provided field-name against all provided values in the values array. The comparison will be for an exact match with the field value.
                  * `set_exclude` - This mode will match the record for the provided field-name for not having a value in the list of values provided in the values array.  The comparison will be for an exact match with the field value.
                  * `contains` - This mode will match the record for the provided field-name for having one or more keywords provided in the values array. This will be a partial match, not necessary an exact match.
                  * `date` - This mode will do an exact date match
